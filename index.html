            <h3>History </h3>
            <p>
              The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex,
               and points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, 
               but also as far afield as the Levant.[24] Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, 
               Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid[25] show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, 
               the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE. The area was known to the Sumerians as Magan, 
               and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.[26]
           </p>

           <p>
            The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline.
            [27] Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries.[28] Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area,
             the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar).[28] After the spread of Islam in the region, 
             the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. 
             Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period.[29]
           </p>
          
           <p>
           An early mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri.[citation needed] The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry.[29]
